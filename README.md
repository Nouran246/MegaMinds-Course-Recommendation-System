## Description:

Develop a course recommendation system that suggests relevant courses or programs to students based on their
interests, career aspirations, and academic performance. This system aims to guide students in making informed
decisions about their educational pathways, enhancing their overall learning experience

## Key Features:

1. User Registration & Authentication:
o Users can sign up as students, instructors, or admins.
o Implement secure access with email verification and password reset functionalities.
2. Admin Dashboard:
o Admins can manage users (students and instructors), oversee course offerings, and configure platformsettings.
o View analytics on student course enrollments, preferences, and overall engagement.
3. User Profile Creation:
o Students can create profiles that include their interests, career goals, academic history, and preferred learning
styles.
o The system uses this information to generate tailored course recommendations.
4. Algorithmic Course Suggestions:
o The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze student profiles and performance data, generating
personalized course recommendations.
o Suggestions are based on a combination of student interests, previous courses taken, and market demand for
specific skills.
5. Resource Integration:
o Students receive links to recommended courses along with additional resources such as articles, videos, and
online tools that complement their learning.
o The platform provides insights into course content and objectives to help students make informedchoices.
6. Discussion Forum:
o A forum allows students to discuss course recommendations, share experiences, and seek advice from peers
and instructors.
o Instructors can participate in discussions to provide further insights on recommended courses.
7. Progress Tracking and Feedback:
o Students can track their progress in courses they enroll in based on recommendations, receiving updates on
completed tasks and overall performance.
o The system can suggest additional courses based on student progress and evolving interests.
8. Feedback Mechanism:
Students can provide feedback on course recommendations and their experiences, allowing the system to refine its
algorithms and improve future suggestions.
Admins and instructors can access aggregated feedback to identify trends and enhance courseofferings.
